1. request and response objects are created by the Tomcat container per access.
2. request object contains info about request and metadata associated with the request and response will be a clean slate handed over to the Custom Servlet class.
3. Servlet itself is an object but it's not created per access;it gets reused using threads.
4. session is an tomcat provided object which is used to make servlet remember the last supplied value to the servlet.but, it will 
   not be available for all the users/browsers.
5. context will solve problem of session object and makes attribute available across the application.
