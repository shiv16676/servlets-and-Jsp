Question:- Why we are not using Annotations so much if they are easy to use???

Answer:- There are pros and cons of using annotations , below are the details-

 1. Annotation are supported only after java-5 version; so in order to understand the code which was written earlier, we need to know the web.xml way.
 2. Since Annotations are tied to a particular servlet/class, so everytime we make any change, we need to compile/package entire class whereas if we use web.xml we only 
    need to restart the tomcat instance.
